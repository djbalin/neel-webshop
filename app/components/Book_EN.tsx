            Each chapter is divided into 3 parts: <b>Reading Comprehension</b>,{" "}
            <b>Writing Composition</b> and <b>Oral Communication</b>, enabling
            students to acquire the skills needed to pass the Danish Exam 3 with
            a successful result.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            In addition to PD3-style reading, writing, and speaking tasks, Facet
            includes a wide variety of task types that prepare students for PD3.
            The tasks also engage students in discussions and dilemmas on
            current and relevant topics.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p className="paragraph">
              Alongside this, there is a focus on grammar, including verbs,
              adjectives, nouns, conjunctions, and word order, as well as audio
              exercises where students hear Danish as it is spoken among
              friends, colleagues, and classmates.
            </p>

            <p className="paragraph">
              At the back of the book, youâ€™ll find helpful reference pages with
              conjunctions, a complete review of the Danish Exam 3, various
              templates for structuring both oral and written PD3 tasks,
              overviews of relevant expressions for both written and oral use,
              as well as invaluable tips and advice.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              The book is particularly well-suited for exam preparation courses
              and encourages fun and inspiring pair and group exercises, but it
              can also be used for self-study.
